This checklist is now tailored to your low-friction, "register-at-checkout" model.

Tier 1: Critical (Must-Haves for Launch)
Implement Stateless Generation Tracking:

Use the browser's localStorage to track the 3 free generation rounds for anonymous users.

Update all Website Copy:

Change all "100% Free" language to reflect the freemium model ("Start for free," etc.).

"Register-at-Checkout" User Account System:

Build a user registration flow that is integrated into the payment process. A user should not be asked to register until they have decided to pay.

Payment Gateway Integration:

Integrate a payment provider (e.g., Stripe) to handle the â‚¬10 fee.

Develop the Paywall & Gated Features:

Build the UI that locks generation after 3 rounds and directs users to the payment/registration flow.

Ensure SVG downloads are restricted until a user has successfully paid.

Terms of Service & Privacy Policy:

Update your ToS to include payment terms, refund policy, and account creation details.

Ensure your Privacy Policy is accurate.

Add a "Contact Us" / Support Method.

Implement API Rate Limiting: (Server-side) Still essential to prevent programmatic abuse of your free generation endpoint.

Tier 2: Highly Recommended
"Claim Your Logos" Feature: If a user clears their cache and loses their guest session, have a way for them to "claim" their work if they remember the prompts, or offer support to help them find it.

User Dashboard: After registering, users should be taken to a simple dashboard where they can see all the logos they created as a guest and their new premium status.
