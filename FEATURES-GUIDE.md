## üéØ Logo Generation Tips

### Initial Generation

**Provide clear business details:**
- Business name (required)
- Industry (helps AI understand context)
- Description (be specific about what you do)
- Colors (if you have brand colors)
- Style preferences (modern, classic, playful, etc.)

**Upload reference images (optional):**
- Up to 3 reference images
- Shows AI your preferred style
- Can be logos you like, color palettes, or design inspiration

**Choose logo type:**
- **Wordmark:** Text-focused, minimal symbols (like Google, Coca-Cola)
- **Pictorial:** Icon-focused, minimal text (like Apple, Twitter)

### Refinement Tips

**Be specific in feedback:**
- ‚ùå "Make it better"
- ‚úÖ "Make the text bolder and use darker blue"

- ‚ùå "I don't like it"
- ‚úÖ "The icon is too complex, simplify to 3-4 shapes max"

- ‚ùå "Change colors"
- ‚úÖ "Replace orange with forest green (#228B22)"

**Iterative approach:**
- Make one type of change per round
- Don't request too many changes at once
- Round 1: Fix colors
- Round 2: Adjust text
- Round 3: Fine-tune icon

**Use selection strategically:**
- Select logos that are close to what you want
- AI will use them as visual reference
- Don't select if you want completely new directions

## üöÄ Best Practices

### Do's ‚úÖ

- Start with clear business information
- Use specific, actionable feedback
- Iterate one element at a time
- Save logos you like to your collection
- Try both batch and single-logo modes
- Download multiple formats for different uses

### Don'ts ‚ùå

- Don't rush the refinement process
- Don't request contradictory changes in one round
- Don't skip the feedback - generic prompts = generic results
- Don't forget to save logos before closing browser
- Don't use all 15 credits on first iteration - refine!

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**"Why did I lose a credit if I didn't like the results?"**
- Each generation request uses 1 credit regardless of output
- This covers AI processing costs
- Refine with feedback instead of regenerating from scratch

**"Can I get more free credits?"**
- Free tier is limited to 15 credits total
- Upgrade to premium for unlimited access
- One-time payment of ‚Ç¨9.99

**"How do I switch between refinement modes?"**
- Click ‚ú® on any logo to enter single-logo mode
- Click "Exit Mode" to return to batch mode
- Modes can be switched anytime

**"My focused logo disappeared when I refined"**
- This is expected - refinement generates new variations
- The focused logo serves as the reference for new generation
- Save the original to your collection before refining if you want to keep it

**"Can I refine a saved logo later?"**
- Yes! Go to your saved logos gallery
- Click ‚ú® on any saved logo to start refining it
- Works the same as refining fresh generations
